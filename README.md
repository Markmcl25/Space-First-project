# Design

### Color scheme

I went with a very rigid color scheme with the hex color #010b19 as I felt this color suited the theme of space and the cosmos. RGB value is (1,11,25).

### Typography

I went for a Google font Jost as I felt it fitted the theme and it looks modern. Please see screenshot below.
